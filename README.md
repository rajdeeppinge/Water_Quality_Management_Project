# Water_Quality_Management_Project

Water quality is determined by various parameters such as temperature, pH, turbidity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), Total Dissolved Solid(TDS). The most common method to detect these parameters is to collect samples manually and then send them to laboratory for detecting and analyzing. This method wastes too much manpower and material resource, and has the limitations of the samples collection, long duration of experiment and analysis, ageing of experiment equipment and other issues. To solve these problems sensor have been used which can convert information about characteristics of water into electrical signals. They can easily transfer, process, transform and control signals, and have many special advantages such as good selectivity, high sensitivity, fast response speed, etc. According to these characteristics and advantages of sensors and with the help of Arduino micro-controller, automatic measurement and reporting system of water quality has been designed and developed. Further, these sensors have been linked by GSM network to instantaneously transfer the collected data through SMS to the user.
